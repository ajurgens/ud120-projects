Naive Bayes mini-project

 We have a set of emails, half of which were written by one person and the other half by another person at the same company . The objective is to classify the emails as written by one person or the other based only on the text of the email.

 I create and trained a Naive Bayes classifier in naive_bayes/nb_author_id.py. Used it to make predictions for the test set and to find the accuracy.
